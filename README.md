## This is a bulleted list about why I like Info 201:
- it teaches me great skills that I will be able to apply in the real world
- it goes at a nice pace for beginning coders
- Professor Thayer teaches the calss very well
- Coding is always something I've wanted to learn and with this class, i get to do that.
